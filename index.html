<h1>Hi! My name is Erika Shiokawa.</h1>
<p>I am from Japan. My nationality is Japanese and I don't speak Tagalog but I am half-Filipino.</p>
<p>I was born in Japan and grew up there. But when I was 10th grade, I moved to the US, California.</p>
<p>So I graduated High School in the US. After I graduted High School, I went back to Japan and I am studying in the Philippines now.</p>
<p>I had never been in the Philippines until I enrolled APC. It is also first time for me being separated from my family. I stay in the dorm.</p>
<p>Right now, I am stack in the dorm because of the pandemic. The time I stayed here under the quarantine is almost one third of the time I stayed here in the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is sad but still I enjoy studying here. I am looking forward to learn a lot of things.</p>
