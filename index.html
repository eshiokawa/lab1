<h1>Hi. My name is Erika Shiokawa.<h1>
<p>I am from Japan. My nationality is Japanese and I don't speak Tagalog but I am half-Filipino.<p>
<p>I had never been in the Philippines until I enrolled APC. It is also first time for me being separated from my family. I stay in the dorm.
Still I enjoy studying here. I am looking forward to learn a lot of things.<p>
