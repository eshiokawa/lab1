Hi. My name is Erika Shiokawa. 
I am from Japan. My nationality is Japanese and I don't speak Tagalog but I am half-Filipino. 
I had never been in the Philippines until I enrolled APC. It is also first time for me being separated from my family. I stay in the dorm.
Still I enjoy studying here. I am looking forward to learn a lot of things.
